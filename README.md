# C_Yapisal-Programlama

- You can see my own notes and studies about the Structured Programming, which I took in the spring semester of the 1st year, in this repository.
- We used the C language in the Structured Programming class.
- But I also learned C++ language. Because before the classes started, I started learning C and C++ languages.
- In fact, I spent much more time with C++ on this journey that I started to learn C.
